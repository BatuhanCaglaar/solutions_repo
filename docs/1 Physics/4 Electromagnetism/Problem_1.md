# Problem 1

## **Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force**


## **Motivation**

The Lorentz force governs the motion of charged particles under the influence of electric and magnetic fields. It is defined by the equation:

$$
\mathbf{F} = q\mathbf{E} + q\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}
$$

where:
- $q$ is the particle's charge,
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field vector,
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the particle's velocity vector,
- $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field vector.

Understanding this force is crucial in plasma physics, particle accelerators, astrophysical processes, and numerous technological applications. Simulating the motion of particles under these forces provides valuable insights into behaviors like circular motion, helical paths, drift in crossed fields, and confinement mechanisms.

## **1. Exploration of Applications**

The Lorentz force is critical in many real-world systems:

- **Particle Accelerators:** Charged particles are steered and accelerated along desired trajectories using strong magnetic and electric fields.
- **Mass Spectrometers:** Particles are separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio by exploiting their deflections in magnetic fields.
- **Plasma Confinement:** Magnetic fields trap plasma in devices like tokamaks, essential for nuclear fusion research.
- **Astrophysics:** Cosmic rays, solar winds, and magnetic reconnection events are governed by Lorentz dynamics.
- **Magnetohydrodynamics:** The study of magnetic properties of conducting fluids, vital in astrophysics and engineering.

In each system, precise control and understanding of particle motion under electromagnetic forces are fundamental for successful operation and innovation.

## **2. Mathematical Formulation**

### **Equation of Motion**

The Newtonian equation for a charged particle:

$$
\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
$$

Thus, the acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ is:

$$
\mathbf{a} = \frac{q}{m}(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
$$

We can solve this second-order ordinary differential equation numerically using methods like Runge-Kutta.

### **Special Cases**
- **Only Magnetic Field:** Circular or helical motion depending on the initial velocity direction.
- **Only Electric Field:** Uniform acceleration in the direction of the field.
- **Crossed $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ Fields:** Particles experience a drift motion known as the $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ drift.

## **3. Python Simulation**

### **Constants and Initial Setup**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

# Particle properties
q = 1.6e-19   # Charge (C)
m = 9.11e-31  # Mass (kg) - electron mass

# Fields
E = np.array([0, 0, 0])  # Electric field (V/m)
B = np.array([0, 0, 1])  # Magnetic field (T)

# Initial conditions
r0 = np.array([0, 0, 0])
v0 = np.array([1e6, 0, 0])  # Initial velocity (m/s)
y0 = np.concatenate((r0, v0))

# Time settings
t_span = (0, 1e-7)
t_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 1000)
```

### **Equation of Motion and Solver**

```python
def lorentz_force(t, y):
    r = y[:3]
    v = y[3:]
    a = (q/m) * (E + np.cross(v, B))
    return np.concatenate((v, a))

# Solve the ODE
solution = solve_ivp(lorentz_force, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval)

x, y, z = solution.y[0], solution.y[1], solution.y[2]
```

### **Visualization**

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.plot(x, y, z)
ax.set_xlabel('x (m)')
ax.set_ylabel('y (m)')
ax.set_zlabel('z (m)')
ax.set_title('Particle Trajectory under Lorentz Force')
plt.show()
```

## **4. Detailed Parameter Exploration**

### **Varying Magnetic Field Strength ($B$)**
- Increasing $B$ reduces the Larmor radius:

$$
R_L = \frac{mv}{qB}
$$

- Trajectories become tighter with stronger magnetic fields.

### **Varying Electric Field Strength ($E$)**
- Adding $E$ induces an $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ drift:

$$
\mathbf{v}_d = \frac{\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}}{B^2}
$$

- The particle drifts perpendicular to both $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

### **Changing Initial Velocity ($\mathbf{v}$)**
- Alters the pitch and radius of helical motion.
- Purely perpendicular velocity leads to circular motion.
- Adding parallel velocity leads to helical motion.

### **Changing Charge and Mass ($q$, $m$)**
- Heavier particles have larger Larmor radii.
- Particles with different signs of charge move in opposite directions.

## **5. Interpretation and Real-World Applications**

### **Cyclotron Motion**
- Charged particles move in circles in a perpendicular magnetic field.
- Basis for cyclotron particle accelerators.

### **Magnetic Confinement**
- Used in fusion reactors (e.g., Tokamaks).
- Magnetic fields trap high-energy plasma.

### **Space Physics**
- Explains behaviors of charged particles in Earth's magnetosphere.
- Auroras caused by particle collisions due to Lorentz force dynamics.

### **Mass Spectrometry**
- Ions are separated based on their radius of curvature in a magnetic field.
